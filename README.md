# My Implementations of Exercism Exercises

## Why?

I'm a senior developer, but admittedly, sometimes I get tunnel-visioned by the context of the large codebases I work in. Doing Exercism exercises is like the developer equivalent of doing a Sudoku puzzle. Not to mention, I regularly come across helpers in the Ruby standard library that I either did not know about or simply forgot existed. Doing exercises challenges me to get back in touch with the language I work with every day.
